# Aerospace Program Finance & EVM Analysis
This project demonstrates the application of **Earned Value Management (EVM)** principles to track the financial health and schedule performance of a simulated $5M defense contract.

## 📊 Key Metrics Analyzed
* **CPI (Cost Performance Index):** Measuring cost efficiency (Target > 1.0).
* **SPI (Schedule Performance Index):** Measuring schedule efficiency (Target > 1.0).
* **EAC (Estimate at Completion):** Forecasting final project costs based on current performance trends.

## 🔍 Project Findings
* **Average Program CPI:** 0.97 (Indicates the program is slightly over budget).
* **Variance Analysis:** Identified **20 high-risk months** where CPI fell below the 0.9 threshold, requiring immediate corrective action.
* **Risk Mitigation:** The analysis pinpointed "Software" and "Propulsion" as the primary drivers of cost variance.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Python (Pandas/NumPy):** For data generation and financial modeling.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For step-by-step variance analysis.
